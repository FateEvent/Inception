# Inception

Download the image CD for Debian 10 "Debian Buster debian-10.9.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso" from the official site:
* <https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/debian-installer>.

Useful resources to start:

* <https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-primary-partition-and-vs-logical-partition>

For issues that may rise during the installation of Docker on the VM:
* <https://itsfoss.com/apt-key-deprecated>;
* <https://askubuntu.com/questions/307/how-can-ppas-be-removed>.

In addition to the official Docker documentation:

* <https://docs.docker.com>;

you can consult an interesting course offered by Openclassroom (in French):
* <https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/2035766-optimisez-votre-deploiement-en-creant-des-conteneurs-avec-docker>;

* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44769315/how-to-see-docker-image-contents>

For an explanation of the concepts of "continuous integration" and "continuous delivery", see:

Configuration of the VM and installation of Docker Composer:
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mok2J__Ci3Y&t=1s>;
`sudo apt-get install vim -y`

I found really useful a series of tutorials by Grafikart (in French), "Mettre en place un serveur Web", located at:
* <https://grafikart.fr/formations/serveur-linux>

and in particular the following tutorials:
